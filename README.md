glot-run
========

## THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BY [docker-run](https://github.com/glotcode/docker-run) and [glot-run 2](https://github.com/glotcode/docker-run)


## Overview
glot-run provides a http api for running code inside docker containers.
The api is described [here](https://github.com/prasmussen/glot-run/tree/master/api_docs).

## Run
The download above is a standard erlang release that includes a start script.
To start glot-run in the foreground type: `glot/bin/glot foreground`.

## Environment variables
glot-run takes it's configuration from environment variables.
All vars needs to be set, no default values are provided.

| ADMIN_TOKEN          | &lt;string&gt;                | some-secret           | Admin token used to access the /admin endpoints               |

| DOCKER_RUN_TIMEOUT   | &lt;seconds&gt;               | 15                    | Maximum number of seconds a container is allowed to run       |

## Api users
An api token is required to run code. Users can be created with the `/admin/users` endpoint.
See the [api docs](https://github.com/prasmussen/glot-run/tree/master/api_docs/admin) for more details.

## Languages
Languages can be added with the `/admin/languages` endpoint. A language has
a name, version and the name of a docker image that will be used when running
code for the given language/version.
See the [api docs](https://github.com/prasmussen/glot-run/tree/master/api_docs/admin) for more details.

## Docker images
When a run request is posted to glot-run it will create a new temporary container from
the image that handles the given language/version. The container is required
to listen for a json payload on stdin and must write the run result to stdout
as a json object containing the properties: stdout, stderr and error.
An application that does this is [glot-code-runner](https://github.com/prasmussen/glot-code-runner).
Example images can be found [here](https://github.com/prasmussen/glot-containers).

### Container payload
The payload `{"files": [{"name": "main.py", "content": "print(42)"}]}` posted to
`/languages/python/latest` will result in this payload being sent to the
container: `{"language": "python", "files": [{"name": "main.py", "content": "print(42)"}]}`.
A successful run should yield this response from the container: `{"stdout": "42\n", "stderr": "", "error": ""}`.

## Docker configuration
See [docker_server_config.md](docker_server_config.md)
